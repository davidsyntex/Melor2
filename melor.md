### Creation of the Universe

A long time ago there was nothing, then the Storm of Magic came into being. Nobody knows why, not even the Entities, all anyone knows is that the storm carries immense magical power.

The Storm of Magic is giant spiraling storm that encompasses all the worlds. The magical energy in the storm is what fuels a mage's power. The storm also holds all the souls of all worlds who have died.

### The Entities start to emerge

*All pronouns regarding the entities come from how beings of the worlds have seen their vessels, themselves have no concept of gender or sex.*

After a quite long time of nothing happening in the universe parts of magic energy started forming orbs of energy, with time they started to gather more and more of this arcane power. The first race of the universe formed as beings of pure magic power, they were born from the will of the storm.

First emerged the entity *Time*, he sensed that he was in complete control of time itself. He spent what the elves later would call an eternity, alone. The time had an impact on him as his willpower started to break down he started to feel the cold emptiness of an endless storm of magical power with nothing in it. He felt sad and he noticed that energy started to form into an orb, the process was however slow and his sorrow immediate. In an instant the process had been speedup by him and another entity emerged, *Feeling*. *Time* was happy that he had another person to share the universe with. *Feeling* was also glad to see that he was not alone, he greeted *Time* and they became good friends, seeing as there was only two people in the universe.

*Time* and *Feeling* fell in love with each other and from their love came another entity into the universe, *Life*. As a reaction to this the storm started to form another entity that would emerge much later, *Death*.

*Feeling* and *Life* started to test what their powers could do. Their experiments with power of the storm led to a new race of people, it was a frail being and they named it Agrun. It did not live long in the turbulent magical place that the entities call home. The storm took the life of this new race and ate its life-energy until there was nothing left. *Life* was distraught and became sad, this sadness only grew as more more tests of their abilities garnered no lasting results. This sadness increased her will to create something lasting, she drew upon the power of the arcane storm until she could no longer knew who she was.

### Agra is created

*Life* sparkled with power not knowing how to contain it, how to control it. *Time* tried to help his daughter guide this power. What did end up happening is the first world was created, *Life* named her new world Agra after the first beings the Agrun that she and her mother had created so long ago. Looking at what they had created, a place in the storm where others could be safe. She and her father *Time* recreated those frail beings from before, the Agrun. The entities saw to it that the Agrun would survive in this world and watched as new race took its first stumbling steps.

*Death* had not emerged yet so the world of Agra or its inhabitants will never die.

### Melor is created

Some time later *Space* would emerge
